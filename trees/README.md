# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store data in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

implenting binary tree and binary search tree

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Implementing depth traverse of binary tree using recursion.
* The Big O of this implementation 
  * Time O(n)
  * Space O(n)
  


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->

- pre_order method
- in_order method
- post_order method
- add method
- contains method
