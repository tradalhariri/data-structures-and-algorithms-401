# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Stack and Queue are linear data structures and each of them has its benefits and usage.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement the core methods on both Stack and Queue classes and write tests for them.
* Stack
  - push
  - pop
  - peek
  - is_empty
* Queue 
  - enqueue
  - dequeue
  - peek
  - is_empty

----
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Stack 
  - O(1) time and space on all its methods
* Queue 
  - O(1) time and space on all its methods

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
* Stack
  - push : add a new node to the top of the stack
  - pop : remove the node from the top of the stack and return it
  - peek : return the top value of the stack
  - is_empty : check if the stack is empty
* Queue 
  - enqueue : add a new node to the rear of the queue
  - dequeue : remove the node from the front from the queue and return it.
  - peek : return the value of the fornt from the queue
  - is_empty : check if the queue is empty
