# Singly Linked List
Linked list  is a linear data stucture that can add objects dynamically 

## Challenge
* Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Linked List
* Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
   * insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
   * includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
    * Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
   * Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* insert
  * create new node
  * make the next for new node is head
  * make the head is new node.
  * the complexity is O(1)
* include
  * store head in node called current.
  * while current is not equal NULL
  * check if current.value equals the given value.
  * if equal then return true
  * change current to be current.next
  * the complexity is O(N)
